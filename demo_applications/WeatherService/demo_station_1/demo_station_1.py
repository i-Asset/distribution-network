Demo Scenario: Connected Machines
    MachineFleet: at.srfg.MachineFleet.Machine1/Machine2
        Connected machines want to enhance their safety by retrieving temperature, acceleration and position data from
        each other, to warn the drivers on approaching dangerous sections. As each machine measures these quantities by
        themselves, they are shared to others via the distribution-network.
    Analytics: at.srfg.Analytics.MachineAnalytics
        A provider of applied data analytics with the goal to improve the work process and safety. Therefore, data of
        various sources are consumed.
    WeatherService: at.srfg.WeatherService.Stations
        A Weather Service provider that conducts multiple Stations that measure conditions, as well as a
        central service to analyse only this local data. Additionally, the temperature data is of interest for the
        MachineFleet and therefore shared with them.
