Demo Scenario: Connected Cars
    CarFleet: cz.icecars.iot4cps-wp5-CarFleet.Car1/Car2
        Connected cars want to enhance their safety by retrieving temperature, acceleration and position data from each
        other, to warn the drivers on approaching dangerous road sections. As each car measures these quantities by
        themselves, they are shared to others via the platform.
    Analytics: at.datahouse.Analytics.RoadAnalytics
        A provider of applied data analytics with the goal to improve the road quality. Therefore, data of various
         sources are consumed.
    WeatherService: is.iceland.iot4cps-wp5-WeatherService.Stations
        A Weather Service provider that conducts multiple Stations that measure weather conditions, as well as a
        central service to forecast the Weather. Additionally, the temperature data is of interest for the CarFleet and
        therefore shared with them.
